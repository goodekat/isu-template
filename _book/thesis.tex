\chapter{GENERAL INTRODUCTION}

\label{general_intro}

This chapter will have the introduction to your thesis as a whole.

This is the opening paragraph to my thesis which
explains in general terms the concepts and hypothesis
which will be used in my thesis.

With more general information given here than really
necessary.

\isucaption{Example of Rmarkdown based code chunk that includes R code}
\label{code_figure}
\end{figure}

\section{Overview}

Here initial concepts and conditions are explained and
several hypothesis are mentioned in brief. Figure \ref{code_figure} is an example of R code chunk generating a figure.

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
and is examined in the light of current literature.

\subsubsection{Parts of the hypothesis}

Here one particular part of the hypothesis that is
currently being explained is examined and particular
elements of that part are given careful scrutiny.

\subsection{Second Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
and is examined in the light of current literature.

\subsubsection{Parts of the second hypothesis}

Here one particular part of the hypothesis that is
currently being explained is examined and particular
elements of that part are given careful scrutiny

\section{Criteria Review}

Here certain criteria are explained thus eventually
leading to a foregone conclusion.

\section{Methods and procedures}

This is the opening paragraph to my thesis which

\section{Introduction}

Here initial concepts and conditions are explained and
several hypothesis are mentioned in brief.

As can be seen in Table\textasciitilde{}\ref{nothing} it is truly
obvious what I am saying is true.

\begin{table}[h!tb] \centering
\isucaption[This table shows a standard empty table. Please check the code caption for extended instructions]{This table shows a standard empty table. In case of long captions, we want to use the long caption as the description to the table and image but not use it in the table of contents and list of figures/ tables. In order to do this, there are two captions which have been provided, remove the first square bracket options if there is only one small caption. You can use citations like this too \cite{Enf87}}
\label{nothing}

\vspace{ 2 in}
\end{table}

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
and is examined in the light of current literature.

This can also be seen in Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{moon} that the
rest is obvious.

\begin{figure}[h!tb] \centering

\vspace{ 2 in}
\isucaption{This table shows a standard empty figure}

\subsubsection{Parts of the hypothesis}

Here one particular part of the hypothesis that is
currently being explained is examined and particular
elements of that part are given careful scrutiny.

\subsection{Second Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
and is examined in the light of current literature.

\subsubsection{Parts of the second hypothesis}

Here one particular part of the hypothesis that is
currently being explained is examined and particular
elements of that part are given careful scrutiny.

Here certain criteria are explained thus eventually
leading to a foregone conclusion as can be seen in
Table \ref{nevermore}.

\section{Introduction}

Here initial concepts and conditions are explained and
several hypothesis are mentioned in brief.

Of course, data on this as seen in Table\textasciitilde{}\ref{data}
is few and far between.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
and is examined in the light of current literature.

Or graphically as seen in Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{mgraph}
it is certain that my hypothesis is true.

\begin{figure}[h!tb] \centering

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
