\section{Abstract}

This is the text of my abstract that is part of the thesis itself. The
abstract describes the work in the first paper general. You can use the
same abstract as your paper here.

\section{Overview}

The construct of this section or any further section is same as the
authors paper. This is the opening paragraph to my thesis which explains
in general terms the concepts and hypothesis which will be used in my
thesis.

With more general information given here than really necessary.

\section{Introduction}

Here initial concepts and conditions are explained and several
hypothesis are mentioned in brief.

\cite{allen}, \cite{bruner} and \cite{cox} did the initial work in this
area. But in Struss' work {[}\cite{struss}{]} the definitive model is
seen.

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth and is examined in
the light of current literature.

\subsubsection{Parts of the hypothesis}

Here one particular part of the hypothesis that is currently being
explained is examined and particular elements of that part are given
careful scrutiny.

\subsection{Second Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth and is examined in
the light of current literature.

\subsubsection{Parts of the second hypothesis}

Here one particular part of the hypothesis that is currently being
explained is examined and particular elements of that part are given
careful scrutiny.

\section{Criteria Review}

Here certain criteria are explained thus eventually leading to a
foregone conclusion.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

The conclusion of the paper goes here. \cite{cox} \cite{Ancey1996},
\cite{RR73} \cite{Aup91}, \cite{Dou72}
